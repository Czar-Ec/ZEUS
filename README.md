# ZEUS Zombie/Epidemic Universe Simulator
## Final Year Project 2018
### Achieved 70%

### feedback:
Overview of the project: The project implements a zombie outbreak simulator with a scenario editor and a simulation system that models the outbreak dynamics. Strengths: The report is well structured and clear, and the design of the system has been given consideration. The description of the model to be simulated shows a good understanding of the concepts involved. Suggested improvements: The testing could include input from users to provide feedback on the user interface. The conclusions and future work sections could be more detailed with further suggestions for improvements and more discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the project. The implementation of the simulation system could be described in more detail.

=====================================

ZEUS (Zombie/Epidemic Universe Simulator) is a simulator system created to simulate the spread of a disease / zombie-causing disease around the world. The default scenarios in the simulator involvemaps for the world and sections of the world.

The system is split into 2 pieces of software; the main simulator and the scenario creator.
